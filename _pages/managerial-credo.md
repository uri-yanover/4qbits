1. My role as a manager's role is threefold: (i) To build an organization, (ii) To enact control over the routine, and (iii) To impactfully mitigate emergencies.

2. When I build an organization, I'm responsible for my subordinates having an appropriate apparatus, and they're responsible for running it. More generally, a subordinate role is by necessity a partnership, though an unequal one. I expect my subordinates to treat it dutifully. 

3. Failure is unavoidable and perfectly acceptable aspect of (a) growth and (b) velocity. Flag 'em, we'll clean up and proceed  for the next action items. However some failures have a toxicity potential. My subordinates are expected to act out of a duty of care to forestall toxic failures.

4. For control, I expect the subordinate to prepare checkpoints, for example via design review and retros. There's a fine balance to be struck between checkpoints slowing the process down and the benefit of judgement, whether through the effort of the subordinate's self-review required for prpearing a checkpoint or my presence at the check point.
