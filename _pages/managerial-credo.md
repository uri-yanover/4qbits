1. My role as a manager's role is threefold: (i) To build an organization, (ii) To enact control over the routine, and (iii) To impactfully mitigate emergencies.

2. When I build an organization, I'm responsible for the apparatus that includes subordinates, and the subordinates are responsible for running that apparatus. For sure, the subordinates have a lot of say in setting up apparatus and changing up, but the overall responsibility is mine.

3. From the subordinate's perspective, the desired state of things is that the subordinates operate in a "world" of their own in which I am not a routine figure. The subordinates should meet me at checkpoints, preferably asynchronous ones, such as design reviews and retros; we will design these meetings to maximize the ratio of lift (due to expertise) to drag (due to extra work having the meetings).

4. To compensate for the fact that I am not normally present don't live in the same world, I expect the subordinates to invest effort and be proactive in sharing their world-view and the highlights of their statuses explicitly. 
  
5. Failure is unavoidable and perfectly acceptable aspect of (a) growth and (b) velocity. Flag 'em, we'll clean up and move on. However some failures have a toxicity potential, such as personal burnout or causing a crisis with a client. My subordinates are expected to act out of a duty of care to be aware of and forestall toxic failures.
