- The foundation of any relationship, business and otherwise, is assuming ability (competence) and good intent ("doing one's best in the circumstances"). This is especially important for your peers and subordinates. Giving out both positive and negative feedback is a mandatory part of our job, but it should always occur deliberately and while building on that foundation.

1. My role as a manager's role is threefold: (i) To build an organization, (ii) To enact control over the routine, and (iii) To impactfully mitigate emergencies.

2. When I build an organization, I'm responsible for the existence of the apparatus around each subordinate, and the subordinates are responsible for running that apparatus. The subordinates and I will join forces in designing and improving the apparatus, but the overall responsibility is mine; likewise, the subordinates and I will join forces in running the apparatus but the overall responsibility is theirs.

3. From the subordinate's perspective, the desired state of things is that the subordinates operate in a "world" of their own in which I am not a routine figure. The way I can exercise control is by asking subordinates to meet me at checkpoints, such as design reviews and retros. We will design those meetings to maximize the ratio of lift (due to expertise) to drag (due to extra work having the meetings); for example will prefer barriered meetings ("prepare and present") rather than "brain dump".

4. Since the subordinates and I are dealing with two different problems, and will both lack time a lot of times, the way we can help each other is via high quality communications. These build up from a foundation of care and trust on a personal level, properly executed structures (standardized language and routnes) and culminates with effective execution and feedback. It takes two to tango, be a good partner.
  
5. Failure is unavoidable and perfectly acceptable aspect of (a) growth and (b) velocity. Flag 'em, we'll clean up and move on. However some failures have a toxicity potential, such as personal burnout or causing a crisis with a client. Please act out of a duty of care to be aware of and forestall toxic failures.
