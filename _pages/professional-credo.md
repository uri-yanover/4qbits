My credo is composed of three parts:

Making impact ⟺ Team/Togetherness/Conspiracy ⟺ Growth trajectories for people

# Making Impact
Impact is - affecting human beings.

For a commercial organization, one important aspect of impact is prosperity - bringing in money and being a stable professional home for employees.

A different aspect of impact is a product that brings comfort, delight or joy to humans.

In government, impact means helping the general good of the citizens - bringing about security, by increasing wellfare (e.g. by providing better education)

# Team/Togetherness/Conspiracy


# Growth trajectories
