My credo is composed of three parts:

Making impact ↔ Team/Togetherness/Conspiracy ↔ Growth trajectories for people

# Making Impact
In a commercial organization impact means - having an explicit story on how my work brings money into the organization (or at least allows it to save money).

# Team/Togetherness/Conspiracy
T

# Growth trajectories
