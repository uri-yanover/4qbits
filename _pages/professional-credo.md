My credo is composed of three parts:

Making impact ⟺ Team/Togetherness/Communality/Conspiracy ⟺ Growth trajectories for people

# Making Impact
Impact is - affecting human beings.

For a commercial organization, one important aspect of impact is prosperity - bringing in money and being a stable professional home for employees.

A different aspect of impact is a product that brings comfort, delight or joy to humans.

In government, impact means helping the general good of the citizens - bringing about security, by increasing wellfare (e.g. by providing better education)

# Growth trajectories 
That's what people candidly want - somebody to watch over them, to be accountable for their well being, to support them and so on.

# Team/Togetherness/Communality/Conspiracy
"It takes a village to raise a child"; team togetherness is what connects impact and personal growth; the dire straits of the present and the plentiful meadows of the future.

Kindness is not letting go - neither by absence of grace nor by excess of it.

The team working to stay together, to get on the same wavelength, respectuflly, while mindful of the future potential of each member, is what abridges between
