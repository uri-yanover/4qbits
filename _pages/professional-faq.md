**TL;DR**: My job is to do everything necessary for a SW organization to get from Point 0 to Point Value, often over tricky terrain.

# FAQ

> Q: What kind of challenges do you undertake?

A: There are 3 necessary aspects:

- Outcome-orientation: A major transformation is necessary (like 0→1 or 1→100 - not 7→9/"feature factory" scenarios).
- Leadership: it's not just me alone doing things. I'm highly experienced and attentive to hands-on execution, but it takes a team to build value that lasts; I know how to take out a team, and I know how to make them shine.
- Engineering novelty: not doing cookie-cutting. 
  - A positive example: building a new product that requires some kind of technology that is not available for purchase
  - A negative example: you know you need a CRUD API, and just lack the working hands


> Q: So you code for money, right? (Ignoring everything else written here)

A: I do not, and am not going to work with people who think that.


> Q: Could you mentor me?

A: I will happily mentor anyone at any time. I love my profession, and mentorship is the cherry on top,


> Q: I am a recruiter, can I interest you in &lt;anything job-related&gt;?

A: No. See the next point.

> Q: Who are the ONLY people with whom you talk about jobs?

A: Stakeholders at the director/VP/founder-level who would consider retaining me as something that contributes significantly to their own success.

> Q: Why no recruiters?

A: Diamonds burn as well as coal, but are rarer than coal and more useful than coal. Recruiters' job is feeding furnaces. I'd served as a diamond enough times in my career to know that my added value is not through combustion.

> Q: What grinds your gears?

A: People trying to project how shiny they or their organization are. Hint: preoccupiation with anything except the success of your team and its members is an adverse flag in my eyes.

> Q: How do you measure yourself? 

A: By my ability to enact change: in the business (impact), in myself (learning), in colleagues (mentoring/growth)

> Q: How do you treat your subordinates/mentees/charges = what do you expect from your superiors/mentors/patrons?

A: I am responsible for the professional well-being of everyone in my zone of influence. I expect the same.

> Q: Can you do Technology X ⊆ Sp({"NLP", "big data", "cloud", "large systems scaling", "networking", "security design", ...}) ⊕ Sp({Python, Spark, Java, ...})

A: I'm a generalist; I did all of the above well and had fun too. However, I do not believe in being an "X person", and if you have a spreadsheet with a name blank next to "X", I'm not your guy.

In the domain of complex SW, I have experience with:
- Engineering (from product negotiations through API design to writing to debugging),
- Project planning/product roadmapping,
- Building teams, mentoring, promoting team members' individual growth paths, up to and including formal management.
- Analyzing and modelling complex quantitative questions around its design and operation,
- Carrying out and guiding research,
- Writing and collaborating with writers (of descriptions, manuals, operating procedures)
