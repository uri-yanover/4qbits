**TL;DR**: I partner with owners of business to create SW that adds significantly to that business' value.

# FAQ

> Q: You code for money, right? (Ignoring everything else written here)
> A: I do not, and am not going to work with people who think that.


Q: Could you mentor me?

: A: I will happily mentor anyone at any time. I love my profession, and mentorship is the cherry on top,


Q: I am a recruiter, can I interest you in <anything job-related>?

: A: No. See the next point.

Q: Who are the ONLY people with whom you talk about jobs?
: A: Stakeholders at the director/VP/founder-level who would consider retaining me as something that contributes significantly to their own success.


Q: Why no recruiters?
: A: Diamonds burn as well as coal, but are rarer than coal and more useful than coal. Recruiters' job is feeding furnaces. I'd served as a diamond enough times in my career to know that my added value is not through combustion.

Q: What grinds your gears?
: A: People trying to project how shiny they or their organization are. Hint: preoccupiation with anything except the success of your team and its members is an adverse flag in my eyes.

Q: How do you measure yourself? 
: A: By my ability to enact change: in the business (impact), in myself (learning), in colleagues (mentoring/growth)

Q: How do you treat your subordinates/mentees/charges = what do you expect from your superiors/mentors/patrons?
: A: I am responsible for the professional well-being of everyone in my zone of influence. I expect the same.

Q: Can you do Technology X ⊆ Sp({"NLP", "big data", "cloud", "large systems scaling", "networking", "security design", ...}) ⊕ Sp({Python, Spark, Java, ...})
: A: I'm a generalist; I did all of the above well and had fun too. However, I do not believe in being an "X person", and if you have a spreadsheet with a name blank next to "X", I'm not your guy.

In the domain of complex SW, I have experience with:
- Engineering (from product negotiations through API design to writing to debugging),
- Project planning/product roadmapping,
- Building teams, mentoring, promoting team members' individual growth paths, up to and including formal management.
- Analyzing and modelling complex quantitative questions around its design and operation,
- Carrying out and guiding research,
- Writing and collaborating with writers (of descriptions, manuals, operating procedures)
