**TL;DR**: Pros: a lot of money and a great CV line. Cons: professional rot and a mental health hazard.

# The Big Tech Job as a Tradeoff

Overall, I spent about 3 years in semi-Big-Tech and Big-Tech, which were not very pleasurable; at least a part of that is a result of me being 
the first person within a certain social circle to work at Big Tech, which caused me to make some bad choices. 
My main intended audience is for professionals who are making or considering their own first steps in Big Tech, whom I hope to provide with
some guidance on what to expect.

While the sordid specifics may be of interest for a later post, I actually wanted to make one that's entirely devoted to the "big picture".


# The Thesis Pro
## Money; lots of it
Big Tech jobs [pay up superbly](https://www.levels.fyi/). All of the companies in question have troves of cash, and as a matter of prestige, they try outbid each other for 
a contested candidate. A corollary is - if you want to go into the Big Tech job market, do yourself a favor and LeetCode your way far enough to get several offers at once; this will make the compensation cog wheels spin your way.

Right now Big Tech is one of the only options for a reasonably capable person not born into wealth to break the cost-of-living ceiling and to be able to afford 
living in a place that allows a good level of education for children. Current salary levels are high enough to allow some people to effectively retire in their 40s or 50s,
and start a second career without a major risk of suddenly becoming poor in old age. 

The above is especially salient when considering that the other trades that allow that -- most importantly, law and medicine -- mean having worse work-life-balance than
in tech and working essentially until the death of either the body or the mind -- whatever comes first.

## Great career bost
Working at Big Tech is today what used to be going to a great school a generation ago -- a marker of being "far enough" in the modern employment landscape to be "the right stuff" for a wide variety of purposes.

Even a year or two of experience in Big Tech allows you to "get the lingo". Accordingly, for a huge number of things you could want to do after Big Tech, having 
a Big Tech line in your CV would open doors, whether those doors are of more boutique technology operators, of venture capital firms or even of governments. As a 
bonus factor, allumni networks are real and are fantastic career assets for career growth, whether in or out of Big Tech.

# The Thesis Contra
## Hyper-specialization
A lot of Big Tech is about running decades-old lines of business, which means being extremely risk-averse, which means that they converge to relying on 
grossly over-qualified specialists doing menial jobs around keeping the business going than to even start considering any transformative change.
Indeed, among the executives there are very few people who would even be able to oversee a transformative change.

Although Big Tech likes to brag about super advanced technology, the truth is that most people are doing really meh engineering. You'll almost always be basing on company-
internal infra which is almost always a few years behind of what's considered state of the art in its field; it has been most likely maintained by fairly inexperienced people
under a lot of stress to demonstrate some achievement in their periodic reviews -- all of that means you'll be fighting the consequences of other people's bad choices
much more than learning how to make good choices of your own.

Figuring out how to avoid risk as much as possible given a specific technical stack while meeting the business objectives is an important skill, 
but only one of many skills required to turn aspiring professionals into good ones; and for those of us who have been blessed with a professional flame, overindulging
in this line of work definitely quenches this flame.

## Impacted well-being
Big Tech employs a lot of people who already have a decent salary. This is a great recipe for projects not getting anywhere, especially that big organizations 
often have a major communications gap between people who can assess business value and the people who can figure out the engineering required for that value.

Accordingly, the recipe that most organizations converged to is -- feed the pool with motivated people (often fresh out of school) and establish a 
brutal and relentless review regime to keep them moving.

For a lot fo people the above is just the right recipe to descend into a spiral of burn-out, depression and anxiety. The companies only do the convenient thing of covering
the costs of a gym membership and perhaps of a moderately priced therapist; this is commendable but I much rather prefer not having to be depressed in the first place.

For many of us, having major professional challenges could offset those bad feelings; however the hyper-specialization I mentioned above shunts self-realization. 
In other words, for me personally it's very hard to justify not seeing my family by a miniscule bump in a KPI that my contribution would amount to.

# The Synthesis
## No need to be a Genius
My main message here: Big Tech Jobs mainly require the people holding them to be aggressive optimizers of business performance, which typically does not
require genius-level intelligence. Appropriately, the Big Tech recruitment pipeline actually selects people by being able to divert several months of their
attention to memorize the solutions for LeetCode challenges and to deliver them smoothly -- which is, in a way, surprisingly representative of the work
approach required to keep that job after winning it.

## Just a job
A lot of people in Big Tech can testify that their jobs caused an adverse impact to their well-being, first and foremost through anxiety and depression.

Especially for people who are like 2 or 3 years into Big Tech, if that's where you're at -- get out. You already unlocked like 80% of the CV potential, 
and you are literally one interview round away from jobs that are much much better for your well-being - likely outside of Big Tech.

## It's still the people around you that matter
The above narrative is generalization that applies to most of the careers most of the time. From time to time I hear about teams that are Totally Not
Like That, often through getting approval for non-standard recruiting/applicant filtering practices. They are definitely a great way to get the pros,
without a lot of the cons! But --

The one downside to trying to join such a team is that everybody is trying to do that, and they are often kept in their organizations as a 
bait-and-switch -- meaning, you complete the interview round and then hear like "do join for Team Legacy, but in 3 years you'd be able to 
apply for Team Cool". Then in 3 years, you will have burnt out, or Team Cool would have become too cool for anyone with just 3 years of tenure,
but maybe not.

So while counterexamples exist and are actually abundant, they often do not actually apply to the choices relevant for a person deciding to join the 
company.

## If you need the boost, why don't you give it a try?
Big Tech jobs are definitely great for your wallet, and they might be just the pivot  your career needs to start going in the direction you really are craving 
for. Accordingly, as long as you are mindful of the above, I do want to encourage you to spend these few months on LeetCode and to apply - and may the periodic
reviews be ever in your favor!
