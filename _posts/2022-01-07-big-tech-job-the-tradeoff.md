**TL;DR**: Pros: a lot of money and a great CV line. Cons: professional rot and a mental health hazard.

# The Subtext of Big Tech as a Job

Overall, I spent about 3 years in semi-Big-Tech and Big-Tech, which were not very pleasurable; at least a part of that is a result of me being 
the first person within a certain social circle to work at Big Tech, which caused me to make some bad choices. 
My main intended audience is for professionals who are making or considering their own first steps in Big Tech, whom I hope to provide with
some guidance on what to expect.

While the sordid specifics may be of interest for a later post, I actually wanted to make one that's entirely devoted to the "big picture".


# The Pros
## Money; lots of it
Big Tech jobs [pay up superbly](https://www.levels.fyi/). All of the companies in question have troves of cash, and as a metter of prestige, they try outbid each other for 
a contested candidate. A corollary is - if you want to go into the Big Tech job market, do yourself a favor and LeetCode your way far enough to get several offers; this will make the compensation cog wheels spin your way.

## Great career bost
Working at Big Tech is today what used to be going to a great school a generation ago -- a marker of being "far enough" in the modern employment landscape to be a
"generally useful employee" within a fairly wide spectrum.

Even a year or two of experience allows you to "get the lingo". Accordingly, for a huge number of things you could want to do after Big Tech, having a Big Tech line in your CV -- even as internship -- would open doors, whether those doors are of more boutique technology operators, of venture capital firms or even of governments. As a bonus factor,
allumni networks are real and are fantastic career assets as grow, almost regardless of chosen vocation.

# The Cons
## Hyper-specialization
A lot of Big Tech is about running decades-old lines of business, which means being extremely risk-averse, which means that it's better to rely on 
grossly over-qualified specialists doing menial jobs around keeping the business going than to even start considering any transformative change.
Indeed, among the executives there are very few people who would even be able to oversee such a change.

Although Big Tech likes to brag about super advanced technology, the truth is that most people are doing really meh engineering. You'll almost always be basing on company-
internal infra which is almost always a few years behind of what's considered state of the art in its field; it has been most likely maintained by fairly inexperienced people
under a lot of stress to demonstrate some achievement in their yearly reviews, which makes for an overall lost cause in terms of your growth as a specialist.

I saw very few jobs around Big Tech that really required brightness out of people, and even at that, the main brightness was figuring out how to avoid
risk as much as possible given a specific technical stack while meeting the business objectives -- which is an important skill, but probably not one 
that would enable the engineer to grow into other fields.

## Impacted well-being
Big Tech employs a lot of people who already a decent salary. This is a great recipe for projects not getting anywhere, especially that big organizations 
often lack clarity about what engineering work could be good for business.

Accordingly, the recipe that most organizations converged to is -- feed the pool with motivated people (often fresh out of school) and establish a 
brutal and relentless review regime to keep them moving.

For a lot fo people the above is just the right recipe to descend into a spiral of burn-out, depression and anxiety. The company does the one thing it can do,
which is -- to pay for your gym and perhaps a therapist.

The above is especially salient when considering the lack of self-realization that comes from hyper-specialization. For me personally it's very hard
to justify not seeing my family by a miniscule bump in a KPI that my contribution would amount to.

# Neutral notes and Summary
## No need to be a Genius
My main message here: Big Tech Jobs mainly require the people holding them to be aggressive optimizers of business performance, which typically does not
require genius-level intelligence. Appropriately, the Big Tech recruitment pipeline actually selects people by being able to divert several months of their
attention to memorize the solutions for LeetCode challenges while keeping a smooth performance -- which is, in a way, surprisingly representative of the work
approach required to keep that job after winning it.

## Just a job
A lot of people in Big Tech can testify that their jobs caused an adverse impact to their well-being, first and foremost through anxiety and depression.

Especially for people who are like 2 or 3 years into Big Tech, if that's where you're at -- get out. You already unlocked like 80% of the CV potential, 
and you are literally one interview round away from jobs that are much much better for your well-being - likely outside of Big Tech.

## It's still the people around you that matter
The above narrative is generalization that applies to most of the careers most of the time. From time to time I hear about teams that are Totally Not
Like That, often through getting approval for non-standard recruiting/applicant filtering practices. They are definitely a great way to get the pros,
without a lot of the cons! But --

The one downside to trying to join such a team is that everybody is trying to do that, and they are often kept in their organizations as a 
bait-and-switch -- meaning, you complete the interview round and then hear like "do join for Team Legacy, but in 3 years you'd be able to 
apply for Team Cool". Then in 3 years, you will have burnt out, or Team Cool would have become too cool for anyone with just 3 years of tenure,
but maybe not.

So while counterexamples exist and are actually abundant, they often do not actually apply to the choices relevant for a person deciding to join the 
company.

## If you need the boost, why don't you give it a try?
Big Tech jobs are definitely great for your wallet, and they might be just the pivot  your career needs to start going in the direction you really are craving 
for. Accordingly, as long as you are mindful of the above, I do want to encourage you to spend these few months on LeetCode and to apply - and may be periodic
reviews be ever in your favor!
