= The Subtext of Big Tech as a Job

Overall, I spent about 3 years in semi-Big-Tech and Big-Tech, which were not very pleasurable; at least a part of that is a result of me being 
the first person within a certain social circle to work at Big Tech, which caused me to make some bad choices.

While the sordid specifics may be of interest for a later post, I actually wanted to make one that's entirely devoted to establishing a mental
framework underlying what I consider the generality of such choices. My main intended audience is for professionals who are making or considering
their own first steps in Big Tech, however I think that some of the finer points may be of interest to veterans as well.
