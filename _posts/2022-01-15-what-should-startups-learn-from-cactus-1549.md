TL:DR: Cognitive Offloading is the behavior that makes strartups tick - or not

# The Farm Not Bought

12 years ago to the day, an Airbus 320 flying under the call-sign Cactus 1549 and carrying 150 passengers and 5 crew experienced an abrupt loss of thrust on both engines soon after take-off.

The Pilot Flying (PF) at that time was the First Officer, which makes the Captain at that time the Pilot Not Flying; within the next few minutes, the crew made a number of crucial decisions; the first two of these decisions must have been drilled extensively, but beyond that the official script ended, and they played the rest by ear.

The playbook began with turning on the Auxiliary Power Unity to regain electrical power supply and the Captain, being the more senior pilot on the Airbus, assuming controls. He thus became the Pilot Flying; in addition to that he assumed comms, which meant that the First Officer could focus on the engine restart checklist. 

The "happy flow" for this type of accident, one that happens 99.99% of the time, is that at least some thrust is regained to allow an emergency landing in an airport. By taking over controls and comms, the Captain actually freed the mental space for the First Officer to go as much as possible down that path in the short time we’ve had.

When you’re this low and out of thrust, things develop quickly. As a second line of defence, the Captain put himself to play the worst-case game. He chose a nearby airport to divert to, communicated that choice to the ATC, realized that such an attempt was unfeasible and accordingly made the agonizing decision of ditching in a nearby water body, and getting word of that to the cabin crew.

The aircraft having been configured ("lined up") for ditching, the Captain asked the First Officer if he had any ideas. The First Officer did not so the Captain told him to brace.

The point at which this dialogue happened was the only opportunity to align on the inevitability of a ditching; it was put to good use.

20 seconds later and a grand total of 208 seconds since the loss of thrust, the aircraft touched the water surface. An essentially perfect ditching ensued, which means that the plane remained afloat long enough for all passengers and crew to be rescued using watercraft. The event became known as the [Miracle on the Hudson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549). The pilots - Capt. Chesley Sullenberger and First Officers Jeff Skiles - were rightfully recognized as heros.

# What does the above have to do with startups?
So just to begin with the obvious: startups are way less dramatic than that; typically nobody’s life is immediately at stake.

Yet I would not be the first to propose the analogy of startup life to an aircraft that does not (yet) have enough engine power to soar. 

There are several important parallels that the Cactus 1549 story implies directly and unequivocally:
1. Cognitive load management is the skill that made the difference between everybody perishing (as a default) and everybody surviving. While Cactus 1549’s pilots did a fantastic job of making mental room for each other, there were numerous cases of lives lost due to pilots not managing each other’s attention. Similarly, I’d personally heard of startups in which the leadership went into a loop on doing the wrong things, causing an otherwise salvageable business to fail.
2. Although in hindsight the Captain was responsible for the most dramatic part of the action, had the engines been recoverable, the success would have been attributable to the First Officer’s actions. One of them had a success path that involved a lot of dramatic decisions, whereas the other - a pre-designed checklist. A priori, both were equally valuable in managing the different facets of the crisis. The moral here is that heroism is just one approach, not necessarily the best one, even in hindsight, and that success originates in group dynamics rather than individual actions..
3. A leader’s job is to prepare for the worst. However it is often the case that someone else in the organization actually holds the key for some kind of a better outcome, without the leader being aware of it (being rightfully busy planning for the worst). The lesson: teams should be biased to allow for a diversity of team-driven and team-owned approaches – not just to tolerate them, but rather to empower and provide the necessary decision space, resources and encouragement.
4. Conversely, as an employee, your greatest contribution in a lot of cases is recognizing tracks of work that are both transformative for the greater mission and that you can own (as opposed to relying on leadership’s mental presence over time - which simply is too much to ask). 
5. No point is too late to ask the team around for ideas appropriate for the situation, and to attempt acting if something comes up.
