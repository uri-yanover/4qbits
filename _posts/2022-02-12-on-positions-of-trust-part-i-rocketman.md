**TL;DR**: Three key questions: Who trusts you? To do what? Why?

This blog post is devoted to a category of jobs that I find of particular personal interest, being a "big picture" individual. I call such jobs Positions of Trust; I'll discuss below what they involve, but instead of boring with theory, I wanted to provide a highly instructive example.

# The Rocket Man
Even as World War II was drawing to a close, the US Government began investing major attention into creating long-range ballistic missiles that could be used to the cities of potential adversaries with nuclear weapons reliably and quickly. Soon after the war, it became apparent that the Soviet Union was becoming such an adversary; indeed it had set up a strikingly similar rocketry program.

The one person who ended up behind much of the engineering of the American rocket program had a track record of leading the world's most sophisticated rocketry program during World War II, of being a genuine luminary and visionary whose one main aspiration since adolescence some 30 years prior was to enable human space-faring. It should go without saying that the person was held in trust throughout a vast array of US Government organizations.

This is highly surprising, as the person was Wernher von Braun, and the rocketry program he led involved the V-2 ballistic missiles used during World War II to bomb Allied cities as far away as 320 kilometers (200 miles) from the launch sites, in particular Antwerp and London. The V-2s were built using slave labor, which von Braun knew of and indirectly benefited from. While never big on ideology, von Braun had been a member of the Nazi party and had been a commissioned SS-Sturmbannführer, i.e. equivalent to a major; at the start of his US Career - Nazi Germany's defeat in May 1945 - he was merely a prisonner of war.

# Analysis
What forces set up von Braun for success? Why could he be trusted in spite of the above? I propose to analyze his story using three questions: "Who trusts you? To do what? Why?"

* "Who":
  * **What is the trust-giver accountable for?** Promoting the American rocket program was seen as a first-order matter of national security, handled by top level "business owners" - cabinet Secretaries, one level below the President.
  * **What can the trust giver provide to enable the success of the relationship?** In von Braun's case it was investing the efforts to move his German team as a whole from POW detention in Europe to the United States, and allow von Braun to continue leading it.
  * **Alignment of values** – von Braun's personal motivation had been to build better rockets, with the long term dream of making space travel possible. He appears to have been genuinely repentant about his Nazi past, and saw redemptive value in working for the US government
* "Trust": 
  * **Expectations, "having the right answers"** – this category includes behaviors which are relatively well understood to the people involved. For example: deciding on propellant, reviewing mechanical design calculations and maintaining secrecy. Clearly von Braun was a highly trained engineer with a good grasp of the required disciplines. However, he was by far not the only such person, and in more than one way not the "best".
  * **Agency, "having the right questions"** – this category includes proactively exercising judgment to fit some greater purpose. In my opinion it is here that was von Braun's transformative value – he was the person who could proactively come up with and project how to "convert" the greater purpose of developing a missile into the specific problems of how to organize and manage the process of development. In that respect he was unique.
* "To do what?"
  * **Why is the marginal value of the trusted person?** Major new technology fails by default. For the political leadership, the way to enable the success of the rocket program was through establishing an appropriate human apparatus. In that apparatus, von Braun had the vital role of converting engineering insights into actionable administrative decisions.
  * **The price of failure** – for the rocketry program as a whole, the price of failure was the United States' coming into a disadvantaged position relative to the Soviet Union in terms of security deterrence. Such an outcome was widely considered catastrophic.
* "Why":
  * **Why not?** von Braun was a recently former Nazi official. His presence was accepted solely due to rocketry being such a vital US interest that eclipsed the optics of employing him given his past.
  * **Who else?** By the late 1940s, the US had raised a generation of qualified leaders for a nuclear program and for aircraft programs, but not for rocketry programs. So it was either von Braun or a home-grown expert; the price of "growing" an expert of sufficient magnitude is a delay of 2-5 years in reaching major goals. 

# The Trajectory of Trust
It's hard for me to imagine how von Braun with his past was even an option. However the need was dire, and the US did not have a cadre of leaders of similar stature.

The US career of von Braun began in New Mexico where he and his old German teams were asked to continue their prior V-2 work as the Redstone missile design. During that phase, von Braun was denied resources but was put in charge of educating a large cohort of American engineers.

As the Redstone missiles were adopted by the US Army and von Braun's American fame grew, the team was given new resources and moved to Hunstsville, Alabama to form an organization called the Redstone Arsenal. Eventually the group served as the basis for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), where von Baun was the first and only technical director. 

By the late 1950s, the ABMA team produced an evolved Redstone, which was adopted into military use as Jupiter. Jupiter was then up-engineered into the Juno which wasn't a ballistic missile anymore - it was a space-grade launcher. The ABMA team was then merged into NASA, and in 1960 von Braun was appointed as the founding Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center. He accepted that role on the condition he would be able to develop Juno into a design named Saturn. This was accepted; Saturn was developed and was the launch vehicle that brought mankind to the moon in July 1969; von Braun retired from government service 3 years after that, when it became apparent that NASA would stop manned space exploration for many decades to come.

The first person who replaced von Braun at the Marshall Space Flight Center was a member of his German team; the next several ones were his American Redstone disciples; however by the late 1990s, that line had been broken, and the position since has been filled by career bureaucrats. 

# Aftermath
As space travel was becoming less of an open-ended journey and more about playbooks and contractor management, NASA stopped being a literal "moonshot" organization and became a "standard" government contractor bureaucracy. One could say that after some point the balance of trust shifted from engineers to administrators. One can correlate that with NASA stopping being the cutting-edge innovative organization it used to be in von Braun's period, and indeed losing the technological edge to the extent of beginning to rely on Russian launch capabilities; this unfortunate situation was only broken through the innovative work carried out by SpaceX, which did not enjoy NASA's support during much of its early history.

The story above teaches me several crucial intuitions:
* Growth is much easier when you're trusted with a part of the top-line organizational outcomes.
* Technical prowess alone is not enough. One needs to be involved with both major roadmap decisions and with staffing - in plain words, you need achievements attributable to you, and people who will stick with you.
* Having a shared vision is immensely useful for having people stick with you, even if the immediate/short-term goals fall short by a lot of the long-term possibilities.
* It would be extremely rare for a person to be given the trust they "deserve"; at best one can expect several "steps up", each building on the previous one.
* Positions of trust are volatile: they tend to arise only when a need is dire, and often fade away before the need is answered in full.
* Relegating domain experts to advisory/expert roles is unavoidable but it means that they lose trust, which could coincide with the organization losing the edge in that domain. 


Now that we have examined a complete trajectory of a specific position of trust, I intend to write a Part II that applies our learnings to the specific trajectories of employees in the tech industry; stay tuned.
