**TL;DR**: Stick exclusively with people who can be trusted with your professional well-being.

## Core strategy
Murphy's Law is an adage staying "if anything *can* go wrong, it *will*". The uninitiated tend to read that as a drier variant of "life sucks". But for us engineers, the phrase means something quite different: "if something needs to happen robustly, it needs to be *driven* directly, rather than left to occur as a side effect".

My livelihood is building organizations out of people, technologies and culture. Like a lot of people out there, I tend to measure my career via the efficacy of my practice of building and the growth in my skill as a builder. I'd like to present my thoughts on how to drive such growth in a principled way.

My core strategy is simple: I don't choose organizations, but rather specific people whom I see as partners, not bosses, for what I do. I only stick with people who continuously prove that they are accountable for my professional well-being. When that ceases to be the case, I leave. The End.

## Example: for me personally, what does the above boil down to?
To avoid just dabbling in theory, I wanted to give a specific example of what I expect from my partners in crime:

1. Communicating, committing and adhering to a joint vision. Positive example: committing to a certain set of high-value outcomes and carving up the job of making them happen. Negative example: having a discussion with some bottom line, and then doing a surprised pikachu when describing the bottom line to the team.

2. Trying to figure out how to fix longer-term operational/workflow issues when I'm down in the weeds (which I'm prone to), so that I won't have to spend the bulk of my time fighting bushfires.

3. Being attentive to my inputs and investing emotional labor into remediating matters that are not working well; "us" should be important.

## Not Just One Person's Problem
A key pattern that I learnt to recognize is that if nobody is accountable for me, as a high-ability hands-on executor â€“ then likely nobody is accountable for the success of that part of the organization at all.

On the business side, such absence is indicative of there being no major drive for attaining transformative outcomes at all, which means that there's substantially no long-term need in the organization for a product/engineering team. Perhaps the team should be reorganized for doing something else, for example, maintenance or operations, but that'd be a totally different team in the long run.

On the human side, nobody is there to watch for other key people's backs, which means that people will notice and find their way out at their convenience regardless of anything else.

Either way, lack of attention to people's well-being is a tell-tale sign that major trouble is imminent; not just for the people that noticed first that they're left behind, but rather for the team as a whole.

## Capping perseverance
How long is "enough" to decide that I'm no longer in the right company? My rule of thumb is a year. 

Any new job bears a high risk of failure to grow. Prospecting for jobs is akin to building an investment portfolio: one needs to diversify and accommodate for multiple failures over the course of a career. It is likely that I'll need to have worked about 15 jobs in a 40 year career. If I stick for longer than a year at the bad places, I'll have too little for the good ones.

## The sacrifices inherent in that strategy
Optimizing for one's professional well-being means de-prioritizing other criteria. I wanted to demonstrate where I often pay a price to make room for my growth:

- I cannot commit to a mission, however appealing it may be to others, if - as it frequently happens - there's no one watching out for me in it.
- I should not specialize into a specific set of technologies - I won't be"*the* algorithmic maven" or "*the* data guy" or "*the* security guru", although I can be and am highly proficient in all of these areas. This means also giving up on the pay of a super-expert that I could have obtained going down that road.
- I cannot stick with the majority of outstanding individuals I meet along the road - even if they focus on growth in the same sense that I do,  it is too likely that their growth goals would be different from mine.
- I haven't stayed anywhere enough to enjoy postponed-carrot benefits, like the "recharge month" they give out at Facebook/Meta after 5 years or the extremely generous government retirement plan that's only available after 25 years of service.
- I haven't developed my office politics/optics skills/reputation, which is a huge impediment if I should ever have to stay in quite a lot of organizations out there.

## Wrap-up: no man is an island
There's an untrivial assumption in the strategy proposed above: that there's at least *somebody* decent willing to invest into your professional well-being. A lot of people can't come up with even one such person!

However, one thing I did notice during my own personal journey is that there are far more people whom I could team up with than the obvious choices; it's just that I tend to become aware of them too late.

Along the Murphy philosophy, the search for the right people to team up with should be seen as a stream running continuously through one's life; thus it is only through continuously connecting to others one can find their place as a part of the whole. And if you agree with me that those connections are what you need for your self-realization, may you find those other people, and sooner rather than later!
