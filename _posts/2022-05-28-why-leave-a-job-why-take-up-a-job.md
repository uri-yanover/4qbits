**TL;DR**: Stick exclusively with people who can be trusted with your professional well-being.

## A strategy that focuses on personal growth
Murphy's Law is an adage stating that "if anything *can* go wrong, it *will*". The uninitiated tend to read that as a drier variant of "life sucks". But for us engineers, the phrase means something quite different: "for an outcome to occur reliably, it has to be *driven* directly, rather than as a side effect".

My livelihood is building organizations out of people, technologies and culture. Like a lot of people out there, I tend to measure my career growth via the efficacy of my practice of my art day-to-day and the improvement of my skills over the years. Here, I'd like to present my thoughts on how to drive personal growth in a principled manner.

My core strategy is simple: I try never to "work for an organization", but rather "partner with specific stakeholders". I give my partners everything I've got and more; I expect in return that they have a positive impact on my professional well-being. If such an impact does not happen, whether through lack of ability, lack of opportunities or simple neglect, I leave. The End.

## What can a professional partner do to further my professional well-being?
To avoid just dabbling in theory, I wanted to provide a specific example of what I expect from my partners in crime:

1. Communicating, committing and adhering to a joint vision. Positive example: figuring out what new tech needs to be addressed over the next 9 months and splitting up the subtasks needed to making the high-value outcomes happen. Negative example: having a discussion with some bottom line, and then getting a surprised pikachu when I present the conclusions to a wider team.

2. Trying to figure out how to fix longer-term operational/workflow issues when I'm down in the weeds (which I'm prone to), so that I won't have to spend the bulk of my time fighting bushfires.

3. Being attentive to my inputs and investing emotional labor into remediating matters that are not working well; "us" should be important.

## When's the right time to let go?
By no means do I mean that jumping ship should be taken lightly. In fact I strongly believe in trying to persevere for a while before giving up. How long of a bad period is "enough" to decide that I'm no longer in the right company? My rule of thumb is a year. 

Prospecting for jobs is akin to building an investment portfolio: any single choice involves a high risk of failure to grow; one needs to diversify and accommodate for multiple failures over the course of a career. Considering the fact that a "good run" is about 2 years and ends up with a bad run, giving 1 year for bad runs is about as much as possible without letting the downside dominate one's career.

## Lack of individual well-being is a reliable indicator of an organizational failure 
One important thing to note is that although my goal is optimizing *my* professional well-being, under normal circumstances the latter aligns with the good of the organization; just consider the three examples I gave above. This leads me to a key observation: if nobody is accountable for me, as a high-ability hands-on executor â€“ then it is likely that execution is no longer a major priority of the organization at all.

This observation is true for more than just the high performers. Teams that are important for business tend to develop a style of leadership that tries to cut down on the overheads of doing useful things, and in particular develops expertise in carving out complex tasks into bits that are appropriate for all kinds of contributors. The major mode of attrition for such a team would be burnout or exhaustion; if the team is managed well, it can be a nurturing professional home for most team members for many years.

However a team in which people are leaving due to being misapplied is indicative of an oragnizational failure. This is an insidious mode of failure because it arises exactly when there's nobody at the helm, or there's a person who does not act relevantly to the situation; by the time it gets on higher ups' radars, most team members would already be on their ways out at their own chosen speeds. By then, only a very competent and determined salvage effort can save the team from whithering away while causing cascading damage elsewhere in the organization. 

Coming from the higher ups' side, the lack of executive attention to a certain domain means that nothing going on in the team would dramatically effect outcomes. Perhaps the team is misaligned in any case and there could be a dramatic outcome for a different deliverable, for example, maintenance or operations, but that'd be a totally different team in the long run. Even in those cases, the lack of clarity about a different team being needed would mean waste and unnecessary hardship.

## The things I lose by putting bounds on perseverance
Most organizations are dysfunctional in some way or other, and a lot of them come up with the strategy of awarding perks to employees in exchange to putting up with dysfunction. My focus on growth means losing them.

- I cannot commit to a mission, however appealing it may be to others, if there's no one watching out for me in it. This alone hinders a considerable majority of opportunities I have access to.
- Since different organizations deal with different tech stacks, I do not specialize in a specific set of technologies. I won't be "*the* algorithmic maven" or "*the* data guy" or "*the* security guru", although I can be and am highly proficient in all of these areas. This means also giving up on the career path of a super-expert, which is a great strategy practiced by a lot of people out there.
- I cannot stick with the majority of outstanding peers I meet along the road - even if they focus on growth in the same sense that I do,  it is too likely that their growth goals would be different from mine.
- I'm giving up up-front on long-term benefits, like the "recharge month" they give out at Facebook/Meta after 5 years of employment or the extremely generous government retirement plan that's only available after 25 years of service.
- I haven't developed skills for office politics or desirable optics, which is a huge impediment if I should ever have to stay in quite a lot of organizations out there.

## Wrap-up: no man is an island
There's an untrivial assumption in the strategy proposed above: that there's at least *somebody* decent willing to invest into your professional well-being. A lot of people can't come up with even one such person!

However, one thing I did notice during my own personal journey is that there are far more people whom I could team up with than the obvious choices; it's just that I tended to become aware of them too late.

What I realized, along the lines of the Murphy philosophy, is that the search for the right people to team up with should be seen as a stream running continuously through one's life; thus it is only through continuously connecting to others one can find their place as a part of the whole. Whether for this reason or any other, I wanted to conclude this post by wishing that you'd find the people necessary for your growth, and sooner rather than later!
