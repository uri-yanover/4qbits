**TL;DR**: Stick exclusively with people who can be trusted with your professional well-being.

## Core strategy
Murphy's Law is an adage stating that "if anything *can* go wrong, it *will*". The uninitiated tend to read that as a drier variant of "life sucks". But for us engineers, the phrase means something quite different: "for an outcome to occur reliably, it has to be *driven* directly, rather than as a side effect".

My livelihood is building organizations out of people, technologies and culture. Like a lot of people out there, I tend to measure my career growth via the efficacy of my practice of my art day-to-day and the improvement of my skills over the years. Here, I'd like to present my thoughts on how to drive personal growth in a principled manner.

My core strategy is simple: I try never to "work for an organization", but rather "partner with specific stakeholders". I give my partners everything I've got and more; I expect in return that they have a positive impact on my professional well-being. If such an impact does not happen, whether through lack of ability or neglect, I leave. The End.

## How does one impact my professional well-being?
To avoid just dabbling in theory, I wanted to provide a specific example of what I expect from my partners in crime:

1. Communicating, committing and adhering to a joint vision. Positive example: figuring out what new tech needs to be addressed over the next 9 months and splitting up the subtasks needed to making the high-value outcomes happen. Negative example: having a discussion with some bottom line, and then getting a surprised pikachu when I present the conclusions to a wider team.

2. Trying to figure out how to fix longer-term operational/workflow issues when I'm down in the weeds (which I'm prone to), so that I won't have to spend the bulk of my time fighting bushfires.

3. Being attentive to my inputs and investing emotional labor into remediating matters that are not working well; "us" should be important.

## Not Just One Person's Problem
One important thing to note is that although it's *my* professional well-being, it's never for my own sake alone -- the organization is a major beneficiary of virtually every one of the examples above. This led me to a key observation: if nobody is accountable for me, as a high-ability hands-on executor â€“ then it is likely that nobody is actually accountable for the success of that part of the organization at all.

The above holds true for more than just the high performers. Healthy teams have something in store for almost any type of a contributor. It takes quite a bit of organizational dysfunction to even get to the point of ignoring people's being misapplied, and if that point has been reached, the damage has already been done. Once people have noticed that nothing is really happening, they begin plotting their ways out at their own chosen speeds. By then, only a very competent and determined salvage effort can save the team from whithering away while causing cascading damage elsewhere in the organization. 

From the business side, the absence of a drive to deliver transformative outcomes means that the organization is not substantially interested in having that kind of deliverable. Perhaps there's a justification for a different deliverable, for example, maintenance or operations, but that'd be a totally different team in the long run. Even in that cases, such a major change is best done proactively and explicitly -- and not via a vanishing act.

## Capping perseverance
By no means do I mean that jumping ship should be taken lightly. In fact I strongly believe in trying to persevere for a while before giving up. How long of a bad period is "enough" to decide that I'm no longer in the right company? My rule of thumb is a year. 

Prospecting for jobs is akin to building an investment portfolio: any single choice involves a high risk of failure to grow; one needs to diversify and accommodate for multiple failures over the course of a career. Considering the fact that a "good run" is about 2 years and ends up with a bad run, giving 1 year for bad runs is about as much as possible without letting the downside dominate one's career.

## What do I lose by focusing on growth?
Optimizing for my professional well-being means de-prioritizing other concerns. In particular, focusing only on growth positions means losing the perks given for "company loyalty", a.k.a. putting up with dysfunction affecting me. Here are some examples of prices that this strategy entails:

- I cannot commit to a mission, however appealing it may be to others, if there's no one watching out for me in it. This alone hinders a considerable majority of opportunities I have access to.
- Since different organizations deal with different tech stacks, I do not specialize in a specific set of technologies. I won't be "*the* algorithmic maven" or "*the* data guy" or "*the* security guru", although I can be and am highly proficient in all of these areas. This means also giving up on the career path of a super-expert, which is a great strategy practiced by a lot of people out there.
- I cannot stick with the majority of outstanding peers I meet along the road - even if they focus on growth in the same sense that I do,  it is too likely that their growth goals would be different from mine.
- I'm giving up up-front on long-term benefits, like the "recharge month" they give out at Facebook/Meta after 5 years of employment or the extremely generous government retirement plan that's only available after 25 years of service.
- I haven't developed skills for office politics or desirable optics, which is a huge impediment if I should ever have to stay in quite a lot of organizations out there.

## Wrap-up: no man is an island
There's an untrivial assumption in the strategy proposed above: that there's at least *somebody* decent willing to invest into your professional well-being. A lot of people can't come up with even one such person!

However, one thing I did notice during my own personal journey is that there are far more people whom I could team up with than the obvious choices; it's just that I tended to become aware of them too late.

What I realized, along the lines of the Murphy philosophy, is that the search for the right people to team up with should be seen as a stream running continuously through one's life; thus it is only through continuously connecting to others one can find their place as a part of the whole. Whether for this reason or any other, I wanted to conclude this post by wishing that you'd find the people necessary for your growth, and sooner rather than later!
