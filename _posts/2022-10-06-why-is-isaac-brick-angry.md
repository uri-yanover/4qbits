**TL;DR**: Optics ain't much when it comes to life and death.

Today's post is devoted to those who, even when tried by fire, would not stand down.

# The Hero
Everybody who reads the local press knows that Isaac Brik is angry.

49 years ago, Isaac Brik was a 25-year old studying for the last undergrad year of industrial engineering at the Technion. He was also an armor reservist at the rank of Major, assigned as a company commander in the 113th Battalion, about 200 people strong at that time.

I will not retell his story in detail, but it will suffice to say that by the time the war was over two and a half weeks later he was still fighting in spite of having been gravely wounded. Brik ended up being just among a handful of men on the 113th pre-war roster who had not been killed, medically evacuated or held captive by the enemy (the latter group including the batallion's commanding officer). 

After the war, Brik was decorated for his valor and promoted as a reservist. Several years later he re-joined the military full time, serving both in both line commander and staff roles, and rising to the rank of Major General. His last role was that of Head of Personnel Complaints, ending with 2018.

# Criticism and Critique
Since his discharge, Brik has become a vocal critic, indeed a thorn in the current army leaderhip's backside. Without going into all details, the core of his criticism is the lack of military preparedness, especially of the reserves - undoubtedly reflecting the dysfunction that Brik paid for literally with his blood. Brik's criticism is loud, though well-argumented. It is not pretty and totally out of line with top brass's typical confident nonchalance.

Most wise men would not speak; however, one of the younger generation's generals went as much as to argue that Brik was "stuck in 1973", a comment that may be interpreted as an assertion that the failure of 1973 is not going to recur. However, that position, while superficially plausible, implies one the following:
- Either everybody agrees that the failure will not recur (perhaps with the exception of Brik); then there's really no use for the army as it is now, and it should doubtlessly be reduced and the budget diverted to productive fields such as education.
- At least some people besides Brik think that the failure may recur; in that case, the person delivering the comment should probably talk to them and figure out what to believe, because the consequences of a mistake would be disastrous.

# The Rhyme of Time
The Yom Kippur war was culturally a consequence of a great cultural upheaval in many areas of Israeli public life, reaching its peak by the great military victory in the Six-Days War of June 1967.

We're just past Yom Kippur of 2022. As the tech economy is progressing towards a down cycle after a decade of unchecked growth, it is my time to ask which of the assumptions and institutions shaped by unchecked prosperity will crumble - and what implications that may have.
