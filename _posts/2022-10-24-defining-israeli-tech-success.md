**TL;DR**: Israeli tech businesses typically don't grow into successful American corporations. Here's how they can win in a different sense of the word.

# The paradox
A veteran colleague of mine remarked a couple of days ago poignantly - "you do realize that all foreign corporations that I've seen hate the guts of their Israeli branches, don't you?"

That insight to which all present heartily agreed, begs for the question - why do corporates even have branches in Israel? Selling to the tiny and difficult local market is obviously not a sufficient answer.

The above begs a larger question – why is the Israeli tech industry so insanely valuable? Is it just some kind of a bubble? I'm no expert on bubbles, but I do know a few things about the business value of technology. Having considered the matter for a while, I wanted to share some of my thoughts regarding what works - and what doesn't.

# Why does Israeli tech work at all?
A lot of Israeli tech industry veterans would agree with me on the following:

Most major kinds of Israeli businesses face a severa handicap when selling in America. This stems from the American culture being highly nuanced, and the typical Israeli entrepreneur lacking the background to address that nuance. (As an example, just consider the email Noam Bardin publically sent when leaving Google - saying it does not parse well in American corporatese would be an understatement).

A common response to the above is that Israelis would run the tech while the Americans focus the sales. Tough luck though. The Israeli school of leadership looks down on investment in operations, planning and communications – typically to the point of shooting themselves in the foot. Since building a long-term viable geographically diverse company requires a deliberate and potent backbone made of the above, Israeli leaderships tend to not rise for the challenge, which means they lose and fade away when the going gets harder.

Perhaps then, have the senior management be foreign, and send the fabled Israeli engineers - available cheaply at a dime a dozen - be sent in large groups to attack whatever goals the corporate tells them to? Nope. Many American companies successfully follow this playbook in India, but I've never seen it succeed in Israel. Good Israeli engineers are rare, expensive and tend to frown upon the kinds of folly that seems to permeate the aether of bigcorp life. Indeed, it is uncommon for Israeli corporate branch offices to host technically complex profit-center products. 

As a side note, a rare and welcome exception to the above was Intel – due to a happy incident, for about a decade Israel was the main location for Intel's bleeding edge work on CPU architecture design; while Intel is no longer the sole market leader and Israel is not as strong in it, this has sprung a remarkable deeptech industry in high-performance compute design with exciting companies such as NextSilicon and Mellanox.

# What makes the Israeli tech industry amazing nevertheless?
The upside of the Israeli contempt for large organizations and whatever it takes to run them is the Israeli die-hard loyalty to small organic teams, and whatever product those small teams can support.

There are several models in which this ability turns out to be valuable - and worth a lot.

A very frequent and rather successful model for corporate branch offices turns out to be to own complementary (important-but-not-core) product lines in a larger corporate universe - this pattern leverages the fact that Israeli individual contributors can be highly motivated by the outcomes even where the American only sees an endless career-dulling execution quagmire. This pattern captures a lot of the projects going on in the Israeli MAGMA branches, for example the Microsoft Israel which maintains a security product core in Israel - that's definitely a great asset for Microsoft, but hardly a cash cow.

Another model, especially valuable with deep tech, is - keeping it small until the tech/business catches on, and vertically integrating into a much larger industry. Such are the stories of Gong, Vayyar and Flytrex. This attitude requires years of perseverance, or extreme luck being bought out early – one example being Alooma.

A third model is to bootstrap with a geographic pivot in mind - hack together a product with a small team in Israel, win over a niche and then transfer the organization to America. This requires careful choreography and a properly calibrated set of incentives early on, but is doable as long as the head is kept level. I consider SentinnelOne as an example of this pattern.

A fourth model, and probably the only way to genuinely "go big" while remaining mostly Israeli is to focus on the integration/solutions space - this space is heavily stigmatized in a lot of places but less so in Israel.

One category of companies that delivers a lot of value in the integration/solutions space is IronSource, which runs an advertisement empire characterized by rapid, iterative integration with multiple partners. Another bigger, older and lower-margin company in this pattern is Amdocs, which focuses on the telecom billing market. In both cases the traditional Israeli weakness in managing large organizations is counteracted by the fragmentation of the development core across multiple somewhat independent projects.

# Summary
A lot of people have the notion that Israel may just spring up an American-style large corporation, that's also successful. I consider this notion as fundamentally incompatible with the kinds of successful organizations that Israelis empirically manage to build. However, there's an infinity of excellent business opportunities in which Israeli teams can win large rewards by playing to their strengths - and I certainly hope to see more of that going forward.
