**TL;DR**: Opportunism is a pathogen that will eat through every good bit it touches; bad times are imminent

The great Russian poet Iosif (Joseph) Brodsky wrote in the early 1970s
> A person of second-rate times, I proudly
>
> Declare that thoughts I conceived most profoundly,
>
> Were second-rate; I hereby leave them for all generations
>
> As a guide to contending with suffocation
(My own translation)

While a superficial look on the recent government-led reforms in Israel may have the appearance of some principled disagreement over the theory of government, this is not how the reform looks upfront. Indeed, it is, plainly and simply, an opportunistic grab for power; the political regime it aims to establish has no ideological distinction, but is simply a mechanism for the individual survival of a certain milieu of political operators and their patrons, some of whom are not even residents of Israel.

I’d like to use the opportunity to present some learnings from the Soviet society, which entered a similar power dynamic in 1965-1985; right at its end, the period was labeled as "stagnation" ("zastoy", застой). 

# Economics: waste at multiple levels
Opportunism's earliest symptom is the government losing motivation to serve anything but niche interests. Inherently what follows is the waste of public goods (such as the budget), followed by a waste of productivity, a waste of good will and cohesion and over time - a waste lives.

During the Soviet stagnation, the economy simply froze solid in its tracks, exhausted by massive defense spending, high investment/low yield civilian projects and the progressively increasing burden of corruption and black market dynamics.

With respect to lives, a great example is the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, which quickly escalated a proxy war between the Soviet Union and the United States, continuing which was not in the Soviet interest - yet it was allowed to drag on for a decade.

The forecast for Israeli tech should be apparent here: its current assets will be used in a very short sighted way to cover governmental spending. Within a startup generation (5 years), this will drive key people and resources to seek their welfare elsewhere.

# Nepotism/Corruption as a scourge of human capital
Since an opportunist doesn’t care about outcomes, the most advantageous choices for staffing positions are those that give something back to the nepotist - this boils down to choices that are either corrupt or nepotistic or both.

In case the position in question does not accommodate a choice that favors the opportunist, it should at least do as little harm as possible. Hence, the opportunist will not dare to bring in new and promising upstarts - lest they should eclipse them! Even compared with humanity at large, which is pretty cowardly towards giving new people a chance, opportunist regimes are plain and simple scared of brilliant people.

Remarkably hundreds of thousands of people from the Soviet Union who led lives not matching their respective talents, went on to immigrate and win new places for themselves in new countries. There they had a chance to demonstrate their brilliance, breaking through the bonds imposed by immigration and smashing their own individual glass ceilings; such was the story of my own family. Yet, millions of other brilliant people likely could not or did not immigrate, and remained in a society that wasted their talent and indeed their very lives.

Since capable people will notice that an opportunistic regime shunts their growth, should they have even an iota of an opportunity, they will run.

Such is going to be the fate of capable Israelis - Israel is already a major exporter of talent for academia and art; doubtlessly this will also be the case for the talent-rich local industry.

# Normalizing the stench 
A necessary aspect of opportunist governance is an adoption of a specific messaging to delay the government's inevitable fall from popularity
 and then tries to hold off discontent for as long as possible.

One core strategem of an opportunist government is to progressively take over ways to signal merit. 

Consider the following dialogue, which took place between Brodsky - the poet who wrote the epigram to this blog post, and a trial judge, who was soon going to sentence him to mandatory labor due to "not being a productive member of society":

> J: And what is your occupation in general?
>
> B: Poet, poet-translator.
>
> J: And who recognized you to be a poet? Who put you in the ranks of poet?
>
> B: No one. (Unprovoked) And who put me in the ranks of humanity?
>
> J: Did you study it?
>
> B: What?
>
> J: How to be a poet? Did you attempt to finish an institute of higher learning ... where they prepare ... teach ...
>
> B: I did not think that it is given to one by education.
>
> J: By what then?
>
> B: I think it is ... from God.

It is apparent that for the judge it was genuinely inconceivable that Brodsky could be a poet at all without being a member of some association - and of course in the Soviet system, that could only be a state-affiliated association, in which he would be expected to abide by the wishes of the incumbent generation of poets and administrators - a notion that was fundamentally incompatible with Brodsky's temperament as an artist.

The practice of patronage and quid pro quo protectionism has always been present in Israeli piblic life. After a few good decades, with the weakening of public order, that practice is going to come back with vengeance - and of course tech companies, which are highly vulnerable to even the subtlest interference, will be the first to suffer


# Ideology as a long-term infrastructure for oppression
While a lot of Westerners have the mental image of the Soviet Union as a society of Communist zombies, this is simply not the case. As anywhere else on the globe, Soviet political operators tended to follow their own personal interests.

Similar to corporate "company value" sets, state ideologies do not aim to provide guidance on which decisions to make, but rather serve to legitimize the decisions made by those in charge.

In the Soviet Union, communism was used as a pretext to justify the state's various obsessions and to smother discontent regarding the populace's awful living conditions. The notion of ill-willing foreign bourgeois elites was a convenient pretext for both the brutality of the regime and its hypertrophied imperialistic tendencies. But in truth it was all a concealment mechanism for the regime's inability to steer itself to safety.

Likewise, an opportunistic Israeli government will concoct an ideology for preserving itself in power; since the most salient threat to preserving that power is the old elites, these are going to be delegitimized and oppressed. Since a lot of the Israeli tech is culturally closer to the old elites (academia, industry, finance), undoubtedly they will suffer the blow. Doubtlessly it will be cynical and doubtlessly it will hurt a lot of people, doubtlessly unnecessarily.

# Summary
None of what happens in Israel is particularly new to Israel, and neither was what happened in the Soviet Union. 

In the progress of a neglected bacterial or fungal infections, there's a stage in which the pathogen makes it into the bloodstream. Soon thereafter comes a point at which antibiotics can no longer avail, especially if the organism's immune system is already weakened. How far along we are with regard to that, I can't say; I wish all involved best of luck.
