**TL;DR**: How should we search for our own voice? Some ideas regarding inspiration, iteration and feedback.

In the last couple of months I'd been attentively listening to Israel Broadcasting Authority's podcast called ["One Song"](https://www.kan.org.il/podcast/program.aspx/?progid=3). The subject is always the people behind an Israeli song that ended up being popular - the authors, the performers, the producers, the human inspirations and anyone else (curiously, with some interesting stories inside that category). Where possible, an interview is conducted or excerpted; if there are no longer enough interviewees and interviews to work with, prominent experts are brought in to fill in. 

After probably 20 episodes, I think I've arrived at some observations which are worth sharing.

# Inspiration and inception
One very frequent trope in the podcast is that songs are born out of a gag or an in-joke; such is the case with Alma Zohar's *Indian Love Song* (a.k.a. *Miguel*), Kaveret's *Aging Child*, T-Slam's *Gimme Rock'N'Roll* and more.

More generally, it appears that the creative birth of a majority of great songs required a touch of serendipity; people going out a tiny bit out of their regular trajectories, in a way that happens to most of us on a daily basis, but in some cases - leaving behind a seed that could germinate. However, in a huge number of cases, the seed does not germinate! One abundant pattern is authors keeping little boxes with such seeds that they carry with them for decades. In Leah Goldberg's words:

> And then you laughed so hard when I intoned,  
> That I'll approach the heavens' rosy sweetness,  
> And pick it up, and fold it lest it slips us,  
> And store it midst the pages of my tome

(Don't miss out the episode on *And There Was Between Us Just The Shining*!)

# Perspiration and congregation
While boxing and keeping the seed is a skill in itself, it appears that most of the songs discussed require two more things to germinate.

One aspect of that is simply being taken care by a professional - making that seed grow  requires a hefty amount of onward iterative experimentation. At some point in thre song's trajectory, there's a phase of massiive reworking of details big and small: 
  - For music: harmony, beat, groove
  - For lyrics: coming up with a C-part or incorporating somebody else's material
  - For production - taking sound elements from other contemporary work, sampling, etc.). 

However as we all know, such iteration can be frustrating and is likely to never get anywhere. A huge prerequisite of success here is the incorporation of feedback -- and for that, the song needs some kind of a producer that is able to guide and inspire such work. A great example of that is the episode about how Alon Oleartchik countered Rona Keinan's creative effort on an original English text she wrote as *The Earthquake*, in particular by inducing her to sing a Hebrew version as *The Deluge*; after hearing many other stories, it is apparent that while the song's authors bear a huge part of the grunt work, no matter how good they are, somebody else -- who could be a fellow creator or a professional producer -- is needed to unleash the creation's full potential. 

# Search for an artistic self
The avove observation returns me to what is probably the most obvious theme in the podcast - the artists' search for themselves. If previously I was prone to imagining the process of coming up with great works of art as a single auteur's search for diamonds, I now have a different metaphor in mind -- that of a market of people daily transacting with each others using pieces of junk found on the seashore, which for most uninitiated is plain and simple rubbish. However, once in a while, two or three of them manage to cobble something outstanding out of the floatsam; if there are miracles in our world, they are just that.
