**TL;DR**: The history of songs is a great example for how to search for our own voices.

In the last couple of months, I'd been listening to Israel Broadcasting Authority's podcast called ["One Song"](https://www.kan.org.il/podcast/program.aspx/?progid=3). The subject is always the people behind an Israeli song that ended up being popular - the authors, the performers, the producers, the inspirations and so on. If possible, an interview is conducted or excerpted; if not, as is often the case with hits from 40 or 50 years back, prominent experts are brought in to fill in. 

After probably 20 episodes, I think I've arrived at some observations which are worth sharing.

# Inspiration and inception
One very frequent trope in the podcast is that songs are born out of a gag; such is the case with Alma Zohar's *Indian Love Song* (a.k.a. *Miguel*), Kaveret's *Aging Child*, T-Slam's *Gimme Rock'N'Roll* and more.

More generally, it appears that the creative birth of a majority of great songs required a touch of serendipity; people going out a tiny bit out of their regular trajectories, in a way that happens to most of us on a daily basis, but then - leading the creators in question somewhere else. However, it is very often the case that the spark of inspiration happens years before it has a chance to ignite anything. The skilled authors exhibit a pattern of being able to box that spark. Leah Goldberg's wrote about that explicitly:

> And then you laughed so hard when I intoned,  
> That I'll approach the heavens' rosy sweetness,  
> And pick it up, and fold it lest it slips us,  
> And store it midst the pages of my tome

# Perspiration and congregation
While boxing the spark is a skill in itself, it appears that most of the songs discussed only took root after somebody (who could be the original author or another person, e.g. Shlomo Yidov composing *And there Was Between Us Just the Shining*) came to a conjunction of two circumstances:

One aspect of that is simply technical proficiency - making that spark grow into something else requires a hefty amount of experimentation/onward effort - almost everybody on the podcast spoke how they iterate and alter big and small details: 
  - For music: harmony, beat, groove
  - For lyrics: coming up with a C-part or incorporating somebody else's material
  - For production - taking sound elements from other contemporary work, sampling, etc.). 

However a huge basis of that iteration is getting feedback, and here almost all episodes mention a group of people who are given a say in the song's structure. A great example of that is Alon Oleartchik who countered Rona Keinan's creative effort on her original English text *The Earthquake*, in particular by inducing her to sing a Hebrew version as *The Deluge*; after hearing dozens of such stories, it is apparent that while the song's authors bear a huge part of the grunt work, no matter how good they are, they cannot really succeed without skilled editorial guidance of some sort.

# Search for an artistic self
The avove observation returns me to what is probably the most obvious theme in the podcast - the artists' search for themselves. If previously I was prone to imagining the process of coming up with great works of art as a single person's search for diamonds, I now have a different metaphor in mind -- that of a market of people daily transacting with each others with pieces of junk found on the seashore, trying to cobble something clever out of what most uninitiated regard just as rubbish. Once in a while, the right people come by and piece the floatsam into something outstanding; if there are miracles in our world, they are that.
